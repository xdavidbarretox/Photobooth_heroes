How to work with multiple users
Kinect-v2 can fully track up to 6 users simultaneously.
That’s why many of the Kinect-related components, like AvatarController,
 InteractionManager, model & category-selectors, gesture & interaction listeners, etc. have a setting called ‘Player index’. 
If set to 0, the respective component will track the 1st detected user. If set to 1, the component will track the 2nd detected use. 
If set to 2 – the 3rd user, etc. The order of user detection may be specified with the ‘User detection order’-setting of the KinectManager 
(component of KinectController game object).
